An you want to increase the loudness without screwing up rest of the workflow?
why? More devices, more ways to stream content. No real standard to keep audio consistent across platforms. EBU is trying change that with R128
Want to learn more about it? I am no expert so will leave it to experts.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.damitha.xyz/docs/coding/tracing-chromecast-traffic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.damitha.xyz/docs/coding/tracing-chromecast-traffic/</guid><description>Tracing Chromecast traffic via Mac Had problem at work where we need to see debug Chromecast streaming traffic. Chromecast doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow us to change network config manually. Thus needed to force traffic via default gateway where I was able to run mitmproxy
Having the abiliy to provide DHCP leases dnsmasq provides the ability to do that. Quite a simple config
brew install dnsmasq dnsmasq config dhcp-range=10.0.0.32,10.0.0.248,255.255.255.0,2h # Gateway dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.4 # DNS (This is where your transparent proxy runs ) dhcp-option=6,10.</description></item></channel></rss>
